## Mini Data Analysis Project for STAT545A
This is the Mini Data Analysis Project for STAT545A. There will be 2 Milestones for this project. Milestone 1 will familiarize me with working with my choice of dataset and using my knowledge of dplyr and ggplot functions. Milestone 2 familiarized me with making summary tables and graphs, manipulating data types, fitting a model to my data and extracting a result, and also reading and writing data as separate files. This README file is meant to provide context and instructions for this project folder; think of it lke a preface for what to expect. There are 3 main folders for this project, one for Milestone 1 and 2 and one output folder. For Milestone 1, I have 3 main files, a .rmd file, a .md file, and another file that contains the graphs. For Milestone 2, I have a .rmd file, a .md file, and an output folder that contains a .csv and a RDS file. Code from this repository is written in R and can be run in Rstudio. To execute RMarkdown files, you need to have installed R and RStudio. You will also need to install and load the datateachr, broom, and here packages before proceeding.
